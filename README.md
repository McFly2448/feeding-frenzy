# Feeding Frenzy

A browser-based tile matching mini-game inspired by the "Feeding Frenzy" event from the mobile game *State of Survival*.

## 🎮 Gameplay Rules

- Tap tiles from the board — only those that are not covered by others.
- Tiles are added to a shelf with 7 available slots.
- If three identical symbols land on the shelf, they are removed.
- If you reach 7 tiles **without** forming a match of 3 — you lose.
- The goal is to clear the entire board and the shelf.

## 🔁 Features

- Restart and undo (max. 3 times)
- Shuffle button (max. 2 times) redistributes remaining board tiles
- Fully playable in the browser (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Works locally via Python server
